### Homework data analysis project

Ideally, this assignment would mimic a full data science (data mining) project. However, since the main focus of the course was machine learning you don't need 
to spend 80% of your time with data cleaning. You would still have to show you can do some exploratory data analysis (including data visualization), data cleaning, feature engineering etc.

Choose a *publicly available* dataset with at least 10,000 records and 10 variables. 

Do some EDA, data cleaning etc. 

Try several supervised learning methods (and several values for the parameters 
for each method).

Do model selection and evaluation properly (train-test or cross validation etc.) Show various diagnostics (e.g. ROC curve for classification etc.) 

Discuss which algorithms work best on your data and possibly why.

Bonus: Try the algorithms on the raw data without the cleaning. Are the results the same or worse?

Document all the steps in details. Use R-markdown with html output. 
Submit the Rmd and html files containing all your work by uploading 
the files to your github repository and sending me the link. 
The code/documentation must reference the original URL of the public dataset.
