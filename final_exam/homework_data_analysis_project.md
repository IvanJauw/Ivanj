### Homework data analysis project

Ideally, this assignment would mimic a full data science (data mining) project. However, since the main focus of the course was machine learning you don't need 
to spend 80% of your time with data cleaning. You would still have to show you can do some exploratory data analysis (including data visualization), data cleaning, feature engineering etc.

Choose a *publicly available* dataset with at least 10,000 records and 10 variables. 

Do some EDA, data cleaning etc. 

Try several supervised learning methods (and several values for the parameters 
for each method).

Do model selection and evaluation properly (train-test or cross validation etc.) Show various diagnostics (e.g. ROC curve for classification etc.) 

Discuss which algorithms work best on your data and possibly why.

Bonus: Try the algorithms on the raw data without the cleaning. Are the results the same or worse?

Document all the steps in details. Use R-markdown if possible with html output. 
Submit Rmd and html file containing all your work. The code must contain the URL
of the dataset (the hyperlink). Do not submit the dataset itself.
